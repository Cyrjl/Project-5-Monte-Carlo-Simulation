# Project-5-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

The program is in a Jupyter notebook format. To execute it, restart the kernel and run all cells.

The default parameters are (for an electron):
- 0.5 T magnetic field
- -1 electric charge
- 0.511 MeV/cÂ² mass
- 2 MeV/c momentum
- 0 rad opening angle

If the default parameters are not used, the above values can be changed at the start of execution (keyboard prompt).

All figures are saved in png format in the same folder as the program.
